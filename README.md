# Small scripts
Short utilities that I made and use often 

## javar
Use `javar filename` (without the .java extension) to compile and run (with lolcat output) a java program.

## print
Use `print filename` to print a raw document to a printer. Add your printer's address in the script, either IP or hostname. Most printers have 80 char width and 60 char height, and some printers require CRLF line breaks.
